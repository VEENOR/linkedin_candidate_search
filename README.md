# Linkedin Candidate Search
This is a study on how to use Python and Selenium to scrape data from Google, Linkedin to find job candidates based on keyword criteria's.

I started looking into this post by David Craven called [Use Selenium & Python to scrape Linkedin Profiles](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-easy-scraping-data-from-linkedin-profiles-david-craven/ "Use Selenium & Python to scrape Linkedin Profiles")
And a friend of mine that works in HR in a Tourism Company always told me he could use something like a scraping tool to find tour guides in specific locations and how this would save him tons of time.

> *Just to make sure, I'm not a developer I do this for fun so if anyone find anything on the code that could be optimized or improved I would really appreciate the support and help here.* - :raised_hands:

## Let's do this :muscle:
**What you will need:**
1. Python (I'm using 3.8)
2. Selenium installed (check requirements.txt)
3. CSV library (native to python)

**To install requirements use the command:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
