# Linkedin Candidate Search
This is a study on how to use Python and Selenium to scrape data from Google, Linkedin to find job candidates based on keyword criteria's.

I started looking into this post by David Craven called [Use Selenium & Python to scrape Linkedin Profiles](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-easy-scraping-data-from-linkedin-profiles-david-craven/ "Use Selenium & Python to scrape Linkedin Profiles")
And a friend of mine that works in HR in a Tourism Company always told me he could use something like a scraping tool to find tour guides in specific locations and how this would save him tons of time.

> *Just to make sure, I'm not a developer I do this for fun so if anyone find anything on the code that could be optimized or improved I would really appreciate the support and help here.* - :raised_hands:

## Let's do this :muscle:
Most of the information on David Craven post was accurate but as a none developer I had to figure out a lot of things by myself.

For example: WebDrive was not working on my send_keys

So I started putting the pieces together to make this all happen.
I created 2 different testing files one to test Google Search and Interaction and the other to login into Linkedin specially because Linkedin has changed so much last couple of weeks that this whole portion needed to be revised.
